# Face-Mask-Detector
This is a face mask detector built with deep computer vision. This program is able to detect whether you are wearing a mask or not with real time detection.
Here I have trained 4000 masked and non-masked face images with deep neural networks. Therefore, I have used TensorFlow, Keras, Imutils, Scikit Learn and OpenCV to train and build 
the models.
